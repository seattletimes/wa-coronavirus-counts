<p><b>Other notable anomalies:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Data for Aug. 16 is as of 4:30 p.m., not 11:59 p.m., because routine maintenance interrupted lab-report processing at the DOH on that day. This likely caused a lower count of cases and deaths for Aug. 16.</li>
  <li>DOH data cleaning on April 18 removed 190 confirmed cases that were discovered to be out-of-state residents.</li>
</ul>
