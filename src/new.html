              <p>Washington's health department experienced data processing issues on October 10 and 11 didn't provide a daily update.</p>
              <p>Data for Aug. 16 is as of 4:30 p.m., not 11:59 p.m., because routine maintenance interrupted lab-report processing at the state Department of Health (DOH) on that day. This likely caused a lower count of cases and deaths for Aug. 16. </p>
              <p>Washington's health department was severely impacted by wind storm damage on September 8, and didn't provide a daily update.</p>
              <p><b>CONFIRMED CASES:</b></p>
              <p>Total confirmed cases includes deaths. Number of recoveries is currently not being recorded by the DOH.</p>

              <p>Both July 31 and July 11 included the previous day’s data and March 28 had two updates. None are shown, as they skewed the graph.</p>
              DOH data cleaning on April 18 removed 190 confirmed cases that were discovered to be out-of-state residents.</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>DEATHS:</b></p>
              <p>The daily total shows the net change per day in the state’s death count. DOH reports new deaths while also removing wrongly assigned deaths.</p>
              <p>The high death count on July 27 is the result of a backlog.
              <p>On the graph: DOH removes deaths from the total when the primary cause of death is not COVID-19.</p>
