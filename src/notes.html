              <p><b>LATEST:</b></p>
              <p>Starting on July 26, 2021, we are reducing the number of days per week that we publish the chart tracking COVID-19 vaccination rates, coronavirus cases and deaths in Washington state. We will update charts and maps on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.</p>
              <p>Starting Sunday December 2020, DOH will no longer report coronavirus data on Sundays. Data on Mondays will incorporate the case and hospitalization counts from the previous day.</p>
              <p>Data is as of 11:59 p.m. the previous day and is preliminary, as duplicate new cases may be included due to unprecedentedly high testing volumes.</p>
              <p>Washington State Department of Health updates and cleans the cumulative counts for cases, hospitalizations and deaths as it removes duplicate cases, and reassigns cases to correct dates and counties. The historical data shown in this chart will be adjusted every day to match DOH’s data, which includes “probable cases.” The 14-day average will adjust accordingly. Today’s case counts may include up to 1,100 duplicates due to increased laboratory testing.</p>

              <br>

              <p><b>CONFIRMED AND "PROBABLE" CASES:</b></p>
              <p>Total confirmed and probable case data includes deaths. Number of recoveries is not recorded by the DOH. A “probable case” refers to people who received a positive antigen test result but haven’t had a molecular test.</p>

              <br>

              <p><b>DEATHS:</b></p>
              <p>Past 18 days of deaths are incomplete.</p>
              <p>DOH reports new deaths while also removing wrongly assigned deaths. The DOH does not report deaths on weekends. Those deaths will be initially reported on Mondays and Tuesdays and then backdated. Past 12 days of deaths are incomplete.</p>

<br>

              <p><b>MAP CASES AND DEATHS PER CAPITA:</b></p>

<p>Feb. 9, 2022: We have readjusted the color legend to start the break down cases per 10,000 residents by starting legend buckets at 1,200 cases instead of 1,000. This better reflects the differences among counties after a third of the counties previously fell into the top category.</p>
<p>The color legend for <i>Cases per 10,000 residents</i> have been adjusted at these dates: 11/1/2021, 9/20/2021, 5/7/2021, 12/18/2020</p>

<p>Jan. 21, 2022: We have readjusted the color legend to break down deaths per 10,000 residents by starting legend buckets at 10 deaths instead of 0.5. This better reflects the differences among counties after a third of the counties previously fell into the top category.</p>
<p>The color legend for <i>deaths per 10,000 residents</i> have been adjusted at these dates: 1/21/2022, 11/1/2021, 9/30/2021, 5/28/2021, 2/1/2021, 12/10/2020, 11/5/2020, 7/30/2020</p>
